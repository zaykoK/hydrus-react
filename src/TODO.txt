Some way to streamline styling

changePage to starting hash, this way i can do dynamic result number etc.

Caching of content

Redo Tag Buttons so OR queries are two buttons that change into normal tag query when one is removed


Modularize stuff

Add JSDoc comments


Add search/result strictness - Add a toggle which will determine if result are supposed to be showing groups in which given file tag exist or strictly only files with given tag.



Possible Grouping styles:
- Comic - has to be ordered by page, all images must have page: tag
- Single-variants - single image with multiple variants, ordering not necessary
- Single-ordered - single image that has an (obvious or not) ordering of it
- Ordered imageset - image set that requires ordering to make sense from it
-
